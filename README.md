# Healthcare Appointment Wait Time Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes patient wait times using a healthcare appointments dataset to identify patterns and provide actionable insights for improving scheduling efficiency and patient satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
Healthcare facilities often struggle with optimizing appointment scheduling. Long wait times can lead to patient dissatisfaction and potential revenue loss. This analysis aims to understand wait time patterns and provide data-driven recommendations.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Healthcare Appointment Dataset from Kaggle
- **Size**: [99]
- **Key Variables**: Client ID, Request Date, Appointment Date, Provider Role, Full Name, Waiting Time

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Platform**: Kaggle Notebook

## Key Analyses Performed
1. **Wait Time Distribution**: Analyzed how long patients typically wait for appointments
2. **Provider Role Analysis**: Compared average wait times across different healthcare providers
3. **Patient Loyalty vs Wait Time**: Examined relationship between wait times and patient return visits
4. **Appointment Patterns**: Investigated scheduling patterns by day of week and time

## Key Findings
- Most patients wait between 5-10 days for appointments
- Psychologists have the longest average wait times (12+ days)
- Nurses and MDs have similar wait times (8-10 days)
- No strong correlation found between wait time and patient loyalty
- Appointment scheduling shows specific patterns that can be optimized

## Business Recommendations
1. **Expand Psychology Services**: Hire additional psychologists to reduce wait times
2. **Implement Reminder Systems**: Target patients with wait times >10 days
3. **Resource Reallocation**: Optimize scheduling based on demand patterns
4. **Patient Communication**: Improve expectation management for longer wait times
